## 🧠 What is VLSI?

**VLSI (Very Large Scale Integration)** is the process of integrating **millions to billions of transistors** onto a single silicon chip. These chips form the heart of modern electronic devices like smartphones, computers, routers, smartwatches, and more.

### 🔧 Examples of VLSI Chips:
- CPUs (Intel, AMD, Apple M1)
- RAM/ROM memory chips
- ASICs (Application-Specific ICs)
- FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays)
